Used at top institutions for everything from brain and spinal cord injuries to sports injuries, Primal 7 is the only therapeutic product that provides a full body workout for patients at any level of physical fitness.

				<h1>Primal 7 Meets You Where You <br>Are And Gets You Where You <br>Want To Be.</h1>
				<p>A staggering number of studies show that there’s a direct correlation between maintaining an active lifestyle and living a happier, longer life. Of course, that lifestyle can often seem intimidating and unattainable. Primal 7 allows everyone to do the seven fundamental human movements – lunge, squat, push, pull, bend, twist and gait -- from virtually anywhere. A markedly new assistive technology, it gives individuals the independence of movement by removing limitations.</p>

					<h1>Expand your facility’s capabilities, improve patient recovery time and reduce costs.</h1>
					<h2>Treat More Conditions</h2>
					<p>By relieving the pressures of body weight, Primal 7 can be used to exercise a variety of body parts and conditions. It has been used to expedite the sit-to-stand recovery for knee surgery patients, help balance amputees so they can stand on their own, and even support the obese so they can do push-ups for the first time in their lives. Thanks to a patented system of bands and levers, Primal 7 is uniquely versatile in its ability to treat all levels of physical rehabilitation patients.</p>

					<h2>Maximize Your Treatment Space</h2>
					<p>Unlike most brands of rehabilitation equipment, Primal 7 is easy to install and portable, which means less space is occupied by bulky, non-functional parts. Installation can be achieved with as little as a doorway and our patented door anchors, or any number of wall installation options. Ease of placement and no rigorous maintenance requirements means Primal 7 will save you money on multiple fronts.</p>

					<h2>Continuity of Care</h2>
					<p>Primal 7’s ease of use and portability means patients are not limited to one-on-one rehab sessions with a therapist – they can use the unit at home, providing crucial continuity of care. Primal 7 will seamlessly transition from being a rehab product to a fitness product, encouraging your patients to continue living a healthy, active lifestyle.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rehab-sub-content-therapists hidden">
					<h1>Differentiate yourself as a cutting-edge therapist who understands the value of training the body as a comprehensive system</h1>

					<h2>The Body Is a System</h2>
					<p>Even though Primal 7 allows you to focus on training one area of your patient’s body, using body weight as a counter balance ensures that the entire muscular system – particularly in the core – is engaged at all times. So instead of strengthening only one joint or section of your patient’s body, together you and Primal 7 can promote comprehensive wellness.</p>

					<h2>Limitless Applications</h2>
					<p>The ideal treatment routine for any patient is only ever a simple adjustment away. By alleviating bodyweight through the support of a virtually indestructible band, everyone can experience a complete, controlled, full range of motion. Primal 7’s simplicity will allow you to customize your business offerings, your protocol, and your patients’ routines.</p>

					<h2>Safety First</h2>
					<p>The entire Primal 7 unit is designed for absolute safety for both the patient and the therapist. Its specially engineered bands, straps, levers and anchor points provide the support of several additional physical therapists at once, allowing you and your patient to easily transition through the movements.</p>

					<h2>Motivation for Your Patients</h2>
					 <p>Many of the current solutions for alleviating body weight are costly, complicated and require multiple physical therapists to assist the patient. In addition, awkward positions and bulky apparatuses often leave patients feeling inadequate and defeated. Primal 7 empowers patients to move naturally and build strength. By removing failure from the equation, it instills confidence in the patient from the very start. Primal 7 is so empowering that most patients continue to train even after their rehab is complete - transitioning seamlessly into a healthy, everyday routine.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rehab-sub-content-patients hidden">
					<h1>When failure is removed from the equation, your mind will quickly realize anything is possible.</h1>

					<h2>A Sense of Accomplishment</h2>
					<p>By relieving the pressure of body weight, Primal 7 takes the failure out of recovery. There is no exercise that you’re not capable of doing on the Primal 7 unit, literally from day one. Its specially engineered bands are at their strongest when you are at your weakest, helping to empower you through your exercises.</p>
 
					<h2>Portable, with Easy Installation</h2>
					<p>Hang it over a door, tie it to a tree branch, or even loop it around a flagpole – Primal 7 will fit into your life, no matter where you are. Training on Primal 7 with your therapist means that when you leave the hospital, you don't have to leave your rehab behind. The system is designed to evolve with you, strengthening your body through therapeutic exercises and beyond.</p>
 
					<h2>The Power of Human Movement</h2>
					<p>No more dehumanizing, complicated contraptions. Primal 7 training uses body weight and gravity – nothing more. Its simplicity will keep natural human movement an empowering and energizing part of your life, no matter what stage you find yourself in the spectrum of physical fitness.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="roto-content-wellness hidden">
				<h1>A virtually unlimited range of natural human movement for every single body that embraces the band.</h1>

				<h2>One System for Every Body</h2>
				<p>Whether you’re an occasional exerciser looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle; in training for an amateur or professional sport; recovering from an injury; or even if you’ve never worked out a day in your life - Primal 7 will work for you and your body.</p>
				 
				<h2>Make Your Workout Personal</h2>
				<p>Primal 7’s simplicity allows you to customize your routine into something entirely personal. The three band options give as much resistance or assistance as you need. Position and adjust your Primal 7 so that it’s comfortable and ideal for you and the possibilities will be endless.</p>
				 
				<h2>Portable, with Easy Installation</h2>
				<p>Primal 7 is ready to use right out of the box. It can be installed in a variety of locations and is collapsible for easy portability and storage. Gone are the days of bulky machinery that take up too much space in your home, and eventually your garage. Best of all, you can use your Primal 7 unit virtually everywhere, so you do not have to feel limited in where or when you choose to workout. Indoors or outdoors, the choice is yours.</p>
				 
				<h2>Expect More, Do More</h2>
				<p>Primal 7 trains your body as a complete system by working on the feedback loop that connects your brain with your muscles. Alleviating body weight removes the concept of failure from your training. So by training your brain to expect more from your body, Primal 7 lifts the limits on what you thought you were able to accomplish. With these limitations removed, the range of motion that your body is capable of achieving not only becomes possible, it becomes a reality.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="roto-content-military hidden">
				<h1>Strength and endurance is paramount to your performance – Primal 7 will keep you at your peak</h1>

				<h2>Meet Regulations</h2>
				<p>With fitness regulations and standards changing, your state of readiness can never be less than perfect. Primal 7 has been approved and celebrated by retired and active officers in the US Marine Corps. Primal 7 will get you where you need to be and then it will push you farther.</p>
				 
				<h2>Versatile to Meet Your Demands</h2>
				<p>One of the most crucial movements for a solider is to be quick and move out of the way of any potential danger. Because of the range of exercises possible with Primal 7, not only can you train in strength with pull-ups and push ups, but now you can train with speed. The band allows you to practice speed and agility through exercises like sprinter starts, superman jumps, speed skaters, and much more. For recruits this means being able to train from a point of success and reach your physical fitness goals sooner.</p>
				 
				<h2>There When You Need It</h2>
				<p>The Primal 7 unit is lightweight, collapsible, and usable virtually anywhere. Your schedule is unpredictable and you don’t have room for anything that doesn’t add value to your life. At home, in training, or on deployment, Primal 7 will adapt to any situation, fulfilling your crucial need to stay fit and on top.</p>
				 
				<h2>Wounded Warriors</h2>
				<p>Primal 7 gives injured soldiers a way to rehabilitate back to an attainable level of fitness. But more importantly, Primal 7 empowers and encourages those who are suffering from TBI and PTSD with a positive outlook on their physical abilities and an encouraging way to not feel defeated physically and mentally.</p>
