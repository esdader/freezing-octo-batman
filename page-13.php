		<div class="features-description">
			<p>Grab hold of the rings and unlock a myriad of strength building exercises or use them for a little added guidance. A honeycombed inner structure makes the rings lightweight, while a soft rubber over mold creates a non-slip surface to ensure safety while in use. Both durable and comfortable, the rings bring equilibrium and steadiness to every position and exercise.</p>

			<p>Getting in and out of position should be quick, safe, and simple. The Tension Release Levers (TRL) allow for quick-release adjustability for smooth and easy transitions between exercises. The TRLs lock in place immediately with the slightest amount of pressure on the band to protect from accidental injury and release by simply raising the levers to dismount. </p>
