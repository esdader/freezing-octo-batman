			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: Who can use Primal 7?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Primal 7 was made for everyone. Whether you're pre or post-op, going through physically therapy, an elite athlete, or 300 pounds over-weight, Primal 7 meets you where you are, and gets you where you want to be.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: Where can I hook up my Primal 7?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Primal 7 was meant to be taken anywhere. It's first use was on a tree! The anchor attachments were designed to loop around any stable attachment such as a tree, monkey bars, fence post, etc. It was also designed with rubber coated attachments that slide over your door so you can workout right at home.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: Which band do I use?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Each band provides a different level of assistance OR resistance dependent on what you are working out. For more assistance when doing a pull up for example, the heavier the band you choose to use, the more assistance. And the lighter the band, the less assistance.</p>
			<p>Another example: When doing a squat, the heavier band provides you with more stability and the lighter band will require your body to be more aware of itself and work harder.</p>
			<p>In the case of resistance the heavier the band you use, the more resistance you will get. The lighter the band you use, the less resistance you will get.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: How do I lock the rings?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> On the back of the tension release lever there is a nine hook. With one hand, hold the nine hook out. With the other hand, grab both green straps about a hands length down from the tension release lever. Make a big loop and put both straps through the nine hook. Next, slide the neoprene sleeve over the tension release lever. Repeat on other side. Give the rings a good tug before exercising to make sure they are secure.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: Where do I begin/or where should I start with my workouts on Primal 7?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Begin with your 7 primal patterns of movement. Push, pull, squat, lunge, twist, gait and bend. After all, everything you do in life is a variation or combination of those 7 movements. We suggest doing these movements everyday, for at least 30 seconds each. When doing the movements, focus on correct form and pushing yourself to your maximum capacity.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: How do I adjust the band and the rings?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> When there is pressure on the band, the rings will not move. If you need to pull the rings closer to you, simply lift your weight out of the band slightly and pull the rings closer to you.</p>
			<p>When adjusting the band to go higher, first make sure there is no pressure on the band then simply pull the rings down. To make the band go lower, lift both tension release levers and push down on the band with your foot or lift one tension release lever at a time and pull down the band strap. Make sure you always have the band even on both sides before doing any movements.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: How can I get more out of my workout as I progress?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Primal 7 meets you where you need it to, but as you get stronger you can get more out of your workouts in a few ways.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>For certain moves such as the push up or pull up don't raise the band as high as you normally do and give yourself less assistance.</li>
				<li>Use a lighter band</li>
				<li>Do the exercise for more time than usual.</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="faq">
			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: Will I have to replace my straps or bands?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> Yes. The bands are made out of rubber and just like a tire or a tennis shoe they will wear out. You can extend the longevity of your band by storing it indoors, keeping it out of extreme weather conditions, storing it in a safe place where it can hang flat, do not coil or fold the band. <strong>Always check for any wear and tear before use.</strong></p>
			<p>To extend the longevity of your straps, store indoors and keep it out of extreme weather conditions, store in a safe place away and allow it to either hang flat, or fold safely away from sharp objects.</p>

			<h3 class="faq-sub-header">Q: How can I make the band placement the most comfortable on my body?</h3>
			<p><span class="faq-a">A:</span> </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make sure the sleeves are pulled over the band buckles.</li>
				<li>Place the band where you need most support.</li>
				<li>If you are still experiencing irritation you can simply place a towel over the band for extra cushion.</li>
			</ol>
